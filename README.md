# ✨ Tap Tap Who? The Quick-Pick Winner App! ✨

Tap Tap Who? is a fun and fast multi-touch app for randomly picking a winner from a group. Participants tap the screen, a countdown begins, and a winner is chosen! Perfect for quick, impartial decisions or adding excitement to any contest.

## Features

-   **Multi-Touch Mayhem**: Multiple users can simultaneously place their fingers on the screen.
-   **Random Winner Selection**: A fair and unbiased algorithm picks a winner.
-   **Dynamic Visual Feedback**: Engaging circles, pulsing animations, a visual countdown timer, and a celebratory "WINNER!" display.
-   **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Installable on your device and works offline for on-the-go decisions.
-   **Sleek Dark Mode**: A comfortable and stylish dark interface.

## How to Use

1.  **Open the app**: Launch it in your browser (by opening `index.html`) or as an installed PWA.
2.  **Wait for Prompt**: Look for the "Place one or more fingers on screen to play" instruction.
3.  **Fingers Down!**: All participants should now place one finger on the screen.
4.  **Hold Tight!**: Keep your fingers on the screen. A countdown starts once everyone has tapped in.
5.  **And the Winner Is...**: Once the countdown finishes, the winner's touch point will be highlighted, and a "WINNER!" message will appear.
6.  **Play Again?**: Lift all fingers to reset and repeat from step 3 to start a new round!

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5**: Core structure and semantic markup.
-   **CSS3 & Tailwind CSS**: Modern styling, responsive design, animations, dark mode, and utility-first styling via Tailwind CSS.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Powers all interactive logic: multi-touch, countdown timer, random winner selection, and DOM manipulation.
-   **Progressive Web App (PWA) Principles**: Service Workers for offline support and a Web App Manifest for installability, creating a native app-like experience.
